The Slack Events Adapter is a Python-based solution to receive and parse events
from Slack‚Äôs Events API. This library uses an event emitter framework to allow
you to easily process Slack events by simply attaching functions
to event listeners.

This adapter enhances and simplifies Slack's Events API by incorporating useful best practices, patterns, and opportunities to abstract out common tasks.

üí°  We wrote a `blog post which explains how`_ the Events API can help you, why we built these tools, and how you can use them to build production-ready Slack apps.

ü§ñ  Installation
------------

.. code::

  pip install slackeventsapi

ü§ñ  App Setup
--------------------

Before you can use the `Events API`_ you must
`create a Slack App`_, and turn on
`Event Subscriptions`_.

üí°  When you add the Request URL to your app's Event Subscription settings,
Slack will send a request containing a `challenge` code to verify that your
server is alive. This package handles that URL Verification event for you, so
all you need to do is start the example app, start ngrok and configure your
URL accordingly.

‚úÖ  Once you have your `Request URL` verified, your app is ready to start
receiving Team Events.

üîë  Your server will begin receiving Events form Slack's Events API as soon as a
user has authorized your app.

ü§ñ  Development workflow:
------------------------------

(1) Create a Slack app on https://api.slack.com/apps/
(2) Add a `bot user` for your app
(3) Start the example app on your **Request URL** endpoint
(4) Start ngrok and copy the **HTTPS** URL
(5) Add your **Request URL** and subscribe your app to events
(6) Go to your ngrok URL (e.g. https://myapp12.ngrok.com/) and auth your app

**üéâ Once your app has been authorized, you will begin receiving Slack Events**

    ‚ö†Ô∏è  We strongly discourage using ngrok for
    anything but development. It‚Äôs not well-suited for production use.

    üí°  See the example app included in this repository for more information
    on implementing OAuth.

ü§ñ  Usage
-----
  **‚ö†Ô∏è  Keep your app's credentials safe!**

  - For development, keep them in virtualenv variables.

  - For production, use a secure data store.

  - Never post your app's credentials to github.

.. code:: python

  SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN = os.environ["SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN"]

Create a Slack Event Adapter for receiving actions via the Events API

.. code:: python

  from slackeventsapi import SlackEventAdapter

  slack_events_adapter = SlackEventAdapter(SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN, endpoint="/slack_events")

Create an event listener for "reaction_added" events and print the emoji name

.. code:: python

  @slack_events_adapter.on("reaction_added")
  def reaction_added(event):
    emoji = event.get("reaction")
    print(emoji)


Start the server on port 3000

.. code-block:: python

  slack_events_adapter.start(port=3000)

`Scopes`, see https://api.slack.com/events-api

ü§ñ  Examples
--------

See `example.py`_ for usage examples. This example also utilizes OAuth and the
SlackClient Web API client.
